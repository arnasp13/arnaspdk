    <title>Arnas - Personal Site / Why</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>why</h1>

    <h4>creating a personal site from scratch is interesting</h4>
    <p>I kind of miss old-school sites. Well, I don't remember the really really old-school ones myself but I just love
        looking at them. If you ever wondered what the first site looked like, check <a
            href="http://info.cern.ch/" />it</a> out. So my personal site might be inspired by it and I want to develop
        as many things from scratch as I can. Do something extremely opposite to what no-code platforms do.</p>

    <h4>reflective</h4>
    <p>I do (to some extent) believe that <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a> can be
        great. So I'm planning to write some posts here and there.</p>

    <h4>communicate your ideas</h4>
    <p>I sometimes get different ideas on some programming topics, so it could be interesting to start talking about
        them.</p>

    <h4>fun</h4>
    <p>literally</p>

    <h1>things i want to add for this site</h1>
    <h4>styling</h4>
    <p>i will add some styles, i still don't know what styles. but i want to keep the old-school vibe.</p>

    <h4>navigation bar</h4>
    <p>probably a navigation bar on the top. to allow users to navigate.</p>

    <h4>analytics</h4>
    <p>i will add some analytics (third-party package) and i will openly show the reports on this site.</p>

    <h4>about page</h4>
    <p>nothing much. just a few things about me.</p>

    <h4>code snippets page</h4>
    <p>i will add some little code snippets</p>
