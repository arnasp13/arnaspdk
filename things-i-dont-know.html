    <h1>things I don't know/understand</h1>
    <p>2022-08-18</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>
    (an American theoretical physicist) has a nice quote, that I resonated with:
    <i>I don't know anything, but I do know that everything is interesting if
        you go into it deeply enough.</i>

    <br />
    <br />

    I started compiling a list of things I don't understand/know well or at all

    <hr />

    <h4>what is internet, networking/packaging</h4>
    <p>well, everyone uses internet. few (I think) know how it works</p>
    <h4>low level languages</h4>
    <p>I know a little bit of JS. I have coded in C and Assembly. But I still don't understand low-level at all</p>
    <h4>data structures & algorithms</h4>
    <p>I know what ADT, searching, sorting, big O... mean on a high-level. But I don't have a proper broader and deep
        understanding. Though, I think it's also about implementation and practise, so I have been solving leetcode -
        now at 40 problems (mostly medium & easy).</p>
    <h4>javascript</h4>
    <p>I have been using it for a couple of years but I lack proper understanding (maybe it's imposter syndrome) but I
        want to also go wider and deeper. I want to explore things like garbage collection and event loops.</p>
