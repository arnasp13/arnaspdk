    <h4>creating a personal site from scratch</h4>
    <p>I kind of miss old-school sites. Well, I don't remember the really really old-school ones myself but I just love
        looking at them. If you ever wondered what the first site looked like, check <a
            href="http://info.cern.ch/" />it</a> out. So my personal site might be inspired by it and I want to develop
        as many things from scratch as I can. Do something extremely opposite to what no-code platforms do.</p>

    <h4>reflective</h4>
    <p>I do (to some extent) believe that <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a> can be
        great. So I'm planning to write some posts here and there.</p>

    <h4>communicate your ideas</h4>
    <p>I sometimes get different ideas on some programming topics, so it could be interesting to start talking about
        them.</p>

    <h4>fun</h4>
    <p>literally</p>
